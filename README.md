## Architecture

This project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern. Here's an overview of each component:

- **Model**: The data model for this project is represented by the `Tour` class in `models/Tour.dart`. It defines the structure and properties of tour objects.

- **View**: Various Flutter widgets such as `HomePage`, `PostScreen`, and `WelcomeScreen` define the visual representation of the application's user interface.

- **Controller**: The `TourController` class in `controllers/TourController.dart` acts as the controller. It manages the flow of data between the model and the view, handling tasks such as fetching tour data from a JSON file and providing it to the views for display.

The MVC architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with each component responsible for specific tasks. This separation enhances the maintainability and testability of the codebase.
